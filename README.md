# Events-dashboard

# User can search about any event for artist

# Some beautifull cards, One Chart and One Table will show some of the stats that are availble for the artist that is being searched

# In the small card, If the text is too long then it is sliced. To see the full text, just hover it then it will be popped-up in a while

# In the Table, when a user hover over a row then on the extreme left, there will be an icon placed. Upon clicking that icon a modal will be open to show some extra info about that artist specific event

# For chart, Recharts npm library is used

# If data is not available for the artist that is being searched then no "No Data" text is shown on the screen

# A Loading text is placed when data is being fetched from the api
